Original "Better Lava" and variants were created and posted on the Minecraft Forums website
The thread is long since gone but the intention was this lava texture can be used in any pack

Mojang eventually overhauled/replaced texture packs with "resource packs"
It became possible to replace water and lava textures without mods
There is sadly no record of these lava textures ever being updated [or at least, publicly shared after]

Pack was updated in 2020
Pack was re-released in 2023
